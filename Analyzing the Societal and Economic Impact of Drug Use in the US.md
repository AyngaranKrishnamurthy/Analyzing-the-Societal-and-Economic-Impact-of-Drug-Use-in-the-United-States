# Analyzing the Societal and Economic Impact of Drug Use in the United States

## My Why

While the individual consequences of drug abuse, such as health deterioration, psychological distress, and social isolation, are well-documented, its broader implications are often overlooked.

This project is created to serve both as an awareness and a way to portray insights into the effect of drug abuse beyond the individual level, analyzing its impact on a much larger societal and economic scale.

- Correlate datasets using interactive and comparative charts

---

## Key Questions Explored

1. How do Drug-Induced Deaths Compare to Alcohol and Other Causes?  
2. Is There a Pattern Between Drug Deaths and Unemployment?  
3. Does Drug Use Affect the Economy (GDP)?

## Drug-Related Deaths

### Observations:
- Deaths are more prevalent in age groups 25–49.
- Drug-induced deaths exceed alcohol-related deaths in many states.

### Visual Summaries:
- **Figure 1.1 – 1.3:** Total deaths by cause and state (Drug, Alcohol, Other)  
- **Figure 1.4:** Drug deaths by age group (2018–2023)  
- **Figure 1.5:** Trend of drug deaths over time

---

## Unemployment Rates

### Observations:
- High spikes in unemployment during 2008–09 and 2019–20.
- States with high drug mortality often have high unemployment.

### Visual Summaries:
- **Figure 2.1 – 2.2:** Unemployment rates by state and over time  
- **Figure 2.3 – 2.4:** Drug deaths vs. unemployment metrics

---

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

### Observations:
- Sharp GDP decline during 2007–08 and 2019–20.
- GDP inversely correlates with unemployment.

### Visual Summaries:
- **Figure 3.1 – 3.2:** GDP by state and across years  
- **Figure 3.3:** Year-over-Year GDP change  
- **Figure 3.4:** GDP increase vs. unemployment

## Answering Key Questions

**Q1: How Do Drug-Induced Deaths Compare to Alcohol and Other Causes?**  
Drug deaths consistently surpass alcohol-induced deaths in numerous states.

**Q2: Is There a Pattern Between Drug Abuse and Unemployment?**  
Yes, a visible correlation exists, especially in states with higher drug mortality and unemployment.

**Q3: Does Drug Use Affect the Economy (GDP)?**  
Yes. Drug abuse increases unemployment, which inversely affects GDP.

---

## Conclusion

What seems like an individual’s struggle with drug addiction reveals its broader societal consequences. Our analysis illustrates a compelling narrative: **drug abuse contributes to rising unemployment, which in turn impedes GDP growth**. These findings echo academic studies linking substance abuse to economic output.
